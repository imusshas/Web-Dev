AJAX: asynchronous javaScript & XML
is a set of "web development technique" using many web technoloiges on the "client-side" to create aynchronous web applications


With AJAX web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page


We don't use data in XML format anymore.
we use JSON now


we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
2. fetch API (new way of doing)
3. axios (this is third party library)
